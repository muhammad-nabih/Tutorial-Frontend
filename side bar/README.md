This project is an HTML page that contains a simple sidebar created using CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of the sidebar is to provide a user interface for navigating between pages or displaying supplementary content.

## How Does the Sidebar Work?

The sidebar is implemented using the following:

1. **HTML**: The page structure is created using basic HTML elements. The page typically includes `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<aside>` for the sidebar element.

2. **CSS**: CSS is used to style and design the sidebar and initially hide it. It can be displayed or hidden using a toggle, such as a button or icon.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to control the state of the sidebar. When a specific button or icon is clicked, the state of the sidebar changes between being visible and hidden. This can be achieved by changing the CSS class or modifying the display and height properties.

## How to Try the Sidebar?

To experience the sidebar, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file in your web browser.

2. You will see the main page with the sidebar initially hidden.

3. Click on a button or icon to reveal the sidebar.
