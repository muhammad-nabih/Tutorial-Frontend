# Front-End Tutorial Projects Repository

Welcome to my Front-End Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small front-end projects created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects are designed to demonstrate my front-end development skills.

## Projects

1. Project 1: progress bar input
2. Project 2: Generate Serial Number 


Each project is contained in its own folder and includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files necessary to run the project.

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, simply navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also view the live demo of each project by clicking on the project's link.
