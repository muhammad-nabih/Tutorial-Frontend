A simple web application that counts the number of characters entered into an input field and displays it in real-time. It also features a progress bar to visually represent the character count relative to a specified maximum length.

## Features

- Real-time character count: As you type into the input field, the application counts the number of characters and displays it next to the input field.

- Progress bar: A progress bar indicates the percentage of characters used relative to the maximum allowed character count.

- Limit indicator: The application displays the maximum character count as a reference.

- Zero count alert: When you reach the character limit, the character count turns red to alert you.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in a web browser.

2. Start typing into the input field.

3. Watch the character count update in real-time.

4. Observe the progress bar filling as you type.

5. If you reach the character limit, the character count will turn red to notify you.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the web page.
- CSS: For styling the user interface.
